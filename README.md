**🎀 PYTHON MUSIC PLAYER 🎀**
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project is a simple desktop music player created using Python.
It uses the os library to interact with the file system, Tkinter to build the graphical user interface,
and Pygame to handle audio playback. When running the program, the user can select any folder from their system that contains MP3 files.
The selected folder is then scanned, and all the songs inside it are displayed in the music list.
This allows users to play music from any location they want, without needing a fixed folder.

**Features:**
- Select any music folder from your system.
- Automatically loads MP3 files from the selected folder.
- Play, pause, resume, and stop music.
- Change the music folder while the program is running.
- Cute pink / girly themed user interface.
- Customizable window size, colors, and fonts.
- Fully commented code for easy understanding (beginner-friendly).

**Libraries:**
- os
- pygame (requires installation --> ```bash pip install pygame
- tkinter
*os and tkinter come pre-installed with Python, so no additional setup is needed.*

This project was created as a beginner learning experience. While building it, I learned how to use the os, pygame, and tkinter libraries, including concepts such as file handling, GUI design, and event-based programming. I also used video tutorials as guidance and then practiced understanding and applying the concepts on my own for future projects.
